								<h2>1.Never Are You Alone </h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								You’re left in a hopeless situation
								Underwater and so confused
								You want to give up and let yourself drift away
								Gone forever and a day
								<br><br>
								Have you ever thought you were always on your own?
								Left to deal with problems all alone
								Lost and lonely always thinking
								That it felt like you were sinking
								Trust my words, for you are never alone
								<br><br>
								Thinking about them makes your head and heart ache
								Wondering whether you’ll ever be able to break through
								This sense of endless crippling loss
								You spin your wheels and lose control
								<br><br>
								Have you ever thought you were always on your own?
								Left to deal with problems all alone
								Lost and lonely always thinking
								That it felt like you were sinking
								Trust my words, for you are never alone
								<br><br>
								There are many beautiful people out there
								And they are willing to share
								They’ve been through what you’ve had to endure
								While you thought you were all alone
								<br><br>
								Have you ever thought you were always on your own?
								Left to deal with problems all alone
								Lost and lonely always thinking
								That it felt like you were sinking
								Trust my words, for you are never alone
								<br><br>
								Lost ans lonely always thinking
								That it felt like you were sinking
								Trust my words, for you are never alone

								I was so innocent,
								Thought you were protected
								Had faith that tomorrow would come
								<br><br>
								There was only happiness and love so sweet
								Built a world that would stand
								<br><br>
								How could I know what I couldn’t see?
								Have to live with the sorrow, got to make peace
								Gotta move on and remember to breathe
								Can’t stay here forever, down on my knees

								I want to feel good every day
								Instead of feeling like I’m still in mourning
								I thought I’d buried it deep inside
								I could live a normal life on the outside

								But that’s not how you find your way to sanity
								Pretending everything’s alright

								I thought I’d buried it deep inside

								<h2>4.Rewire</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								I doubt everything I’m trying to do
								My past keeps catching up with me
								I keep going back to a place,
								I never wanted to be…
								<br><br>
								Don’t wanna be what I’m not…
								I must rewire my thoughts
								<br><br>
								Took me a lifetime to put that behind...
								To set my soul free. 
								I’ve been a prisoner of the lies they believed...
								That weren’t the truth about me 
								<br><br>
								Don’t wanna be what I’m not…
								I must rewire my thoughts
								<br><br>
								There’s a long and lonely road up ahead
								But that’s where I need to go
								There’s something that’s calling to me
								Something I need to know
								<br><br>
								I doubt every thing I'm trying to do
								My past keeps catching with me 
								<br><br>
								Don’t wanna be what I’m not…
								I must rewire my thoughts
								Don’t wanna be what I’m not…
								I have rewired my thoughts

								<h2>5.Illusions in My Mind</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								Seems like no one really cares
								When you got a need to share
								When you need someone to understand you
								But when you look around nobody's there
								<br><br>
								This got me down and filled with doubt
								I simply started to block everyone out
								I retreated into darkness and despair
								With illusions of compassion everywhere
								<br><br>
								Was it really only in my mind
								That those around me could be kind?
								Was I lost inside by illusions, trapped inside a dream
								How could I have been so blind?
								Illusions in my mind
								<br><br>
								Could this be all about me?
								Building up a wall of selfish fantasy
								so smoke and mirrors are what the people see
								Not the truth, not reality
								<br><br>
								Was it really only in my mind
								That those around me could be kind?
								Was I lost inside by illusions, trapped inside a dream
								How could I have been so blind?
								Illusions in my mind
								<br><br>
								How could I be so blind?
								Illusions in my mind
								Ah ah ah, illusions in my mind

								<h2>6.Shaken But Not Broken</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								They knocked me down but I got back up X 4
								<br><br>
								They called me every kind of name
								They made me feel so very small 
								They meant to make me feel ashamed
								There was no mercy there at all
								<br><br>
								They knocked me down but I got back up X 4
								<br><br>
								I never gave in, I never lost hope
								They didn’t think I could rise up this way 
								But I was stronger than they could imagine
								They couldn’t break me with all of their hate
								<br><br>
								They knocked me down but I got back up X 4
								<br><br>
								It took a toll that I couldn’t bear
								The guilt, it mounted over me
								But despite the pain that haunted me  
								I held on tight pushed forward on   
								<br><br>
								They knocked me down but I got back up X 4
								<br><br>
								I never gave in, I never lost hope
								They didn’t think I could rise up this way
								But I was stronger, than they could imagine
								They couldn’t break me with all of their hate
								<br><br>
								They knocked me down but I got back up X 3
								<br><br>
								Oou I got back up, oou I got stronger, stronger, stronger oou
								They knocked me down but I got back up
								Oou but I got back up
								They knocked me down but I got back up
								They knocked me down but I got back up

								<h2>7.Together in Strength</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								It’s such a very sad thing to see,
								When people are cruel, and their words are so mean
								They thoughtlessly speak from a dark place inside
								Without really caring about what they leave
								It gives them a false sense of being all powerful
								Gives them the right to pray on the vulnerable
								<br><br>
								Together we can stand up and over come it all with love
								Drive out the darkness with courage and faith in us
								Oh Together in strength
								<br><br>
								We must push forward on this path of unity
								Breaking the patterns of mindless hostility
								Learning to speak from a kind place inside
								Putting our fears and our hatred aside
								Wishing and hoping is never enough
								True strength is found when we reach out with love
								<br><br>
								Together we can stand up and over come it all with love
								Drive out the darkness with courage and faith in us
								Oh Together in strength
								<br><br>
								Together we can stand up and over come it all with love
								Drive out the darkness with courage and faith in us
								Together we can stand up and over come it all with love
								Drive out the darkness with courage and faith in us
								Oh Together in Strength

								<h2>8.Life’s Journey</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								My life's jouneywas like passing through the seasons of time
								<br><br>
								In the spring of my life, I was full of wonder
								I was a young tree growing in the rain and thunder
								Lightning crashed around me and my world was shaken
								My soul was weeping, and my heart was breaking
								<br><br>
								And the seasons changed me, oh they rearranged me
								And I grew as years went by
								In the spring of my life
								<br><br>
								In the summer of my life, I thought I was maturing
								Blossoming into fullness but I was still learning
								I was growing wild, and thought that it was freedom
								I made some mistakes, but I couldn’t see them
								<br><br>
								And the seasons changed me, oh they rearranged me
								And I grew as years went by
								In the summer of my life
								<br><br>
								Autumn to winter and my life was bitter,
								Full of what was left undone
								But I found the reason for every season, 
								Led to what I have become - all the seasons of the sun
								<br><br>
								And the years all changed me, they all rearranged me
								And I grew as time went by, in the seasons of my, the seasons of my life
