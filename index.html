										<h2>Resilient</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Most of us experience many trials and adversity throughout our lives. Some more so than others. Although not always shown on the outside, there are many internal scars most people never see.
									<br><br>
									I am simply a songwriter telling of the struggles in life that I have endured and yet survived to become the person I am today. Through the words of these songs, I hope to connect with those who have gone through similar ‘stormy weather’ and reassure them they are not alone.Many believe that you have to go through the bad times to appreciate the good times.I now enjoy everyday with close family and friends and I look forward to tomorrow.
									<br><br>
									These stories transcend all generations, cultures, genders and religions. It is about the human spirit and its resilience to rise above adversity inflicted upon them through no fault of their own. The key to being resilient to what life throws at you is through kindness, dignity and respect of others.
									<br><br>
									My songs reflect my personal history with loss and tragedy. When I was a teenager, my good friend was killed on the roadside as we were walking to town. I escaped injury but the aftermath of such a horrific experience stayed with me. I was left with guilt and had to contend with many negative reactions from the community. I buried my feelings deep inside. I guess this was a survival instinct. At times I felt all alone. Other times I blocked others out. I was becoming someone I never wanted to be. Many people helped me to turn things around. I met a woman who had survived a concentration camp, who was extraordinarily helpful and kind.
									<br><br>
									I finally realised, with the support of close family and friends I had the power to overcome these adversities and begin to live a normal life and not just on the outside. I made the conscious effort to try to be kind to people I meet. This is why I want to share with others who have gone through their own ‘stormy weather’. I think the answer has to be in the kindness we show each other. There is no tragedy there.
									<br><br>
									All the collaborations and recordings were done remote during the pandemic. This shows how technology has come a long way in order to unify through music, even at a distance.
									<br><br>
									Although I wrote the original lyrics, the final version heard in this album is a result of collaboration with two of the most amazingly talented people: My mentor and friend Danah-Lee Krieger (vocalist, pianist) and Jon Park-Wheeler (guitarist). I am eternally grateful for their professional insight and musical direction in the production of this album.
									<br><br>
									A special thank you to: Ken Friesen - Audio Studios for Mixing, Noah Mintz - Lacquer Channel Mastering, Matt Babineau (drummer), Jeremie Tessier (studio assistant).
									<br><br>
