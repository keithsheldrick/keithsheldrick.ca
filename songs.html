											<h2>1.Never Are You Alone </h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											You’re left in a hopeless situation
											Underwater and so confused
											You want to give up and let yourself drift away
											Gone forever and a day
											<br><br>
											Have you ever thought you were always on your own?
											Left to deal with problems all alone
											Lost and lonely always thinking
											That it felt like you were sinking
											Trust my words, for you are never alone
											<br><br>
											Thinking about them makes your head and heart ache
											Wondering whether you’ll ever be able to break through
											This sense of endless crippling loss
											You spin your wheels and lose control
											<br><br>
											Have you ever thought you were always on your own?
											Left to deal with problems all alone
											Lost and lonely always thinking
											That it felt like you were sinking
											Trust my words, for you are never alone
											<br><br>
											There are many beautiful people out there
											And they are willing to share
											They’ve been through what you’ve had to endure
											While you thought you were all alone
											<br><br>
											Have you ever thought you were always on your own?
											Left to deal with problems all alone
											Lost and lonely always thinking

											Lost ans lonely always thinking
											That it felt like you were sinking

											I was so innocent,
											Thought you were protected
											Had faith that tomorrow would come

											There was only happiness and love so sweet
											Built a world that would stand

											How could I know what I couldn’t see?
											Have to live with the sorrow, got to make peace
											Gotta move on and remember to breathe
											Can’t stay here forever, down on my knees

											<h2>3.Forever Changed</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											I thought I’d buried it deep inside
											I could live a normal life on the outside (2x)
											<br><br>
											I want to feel good every day
											Instead of feeling like I’m still in mourning
											I thought I’d buried it deep inside
											I could live a normal life on the outside
											<br><br>
											But that’s not how you find your way to sanity
											Pretending everything’s alright
											Pain that you’ve hidden from your scrutiny
											Must find its way back in to the light on the outside
											<br><br>
											I thought I’d buried it deep inside
											I could live a normal life on the outside (2x)
											<br><br>
											I can’t let those feelings take control
											Or I’ll lose my very soul
											I thought I’d buried it deep inside
											I could live a normal life on the outside
											<br><br>
											But that’s not how you find your way to sanity
											Pretending everything’s alright

											I could live a normal life on the outside (2x)
											<br><br>
											I know I never was to blame

											I could live a normal life on the outside

											<h2>4.Rewire</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											I doubt everything I’m trying to do
											My past keeps catching up with me
											I keep going back to a place,
											I never wanted to be…
											<br><br>
											Don’t wanna be what I’m not…
											I must rewire my thoughts
											<br><br>
											Took me a lifetime to put that behind...
											To set my soul free. 
											I’ve been a prisoner of the lies they believed...
											That weren’t the truth about me 
											<br><br>
											Don’t wanna be what I’m not…
											I must rewire my thoughts
											<br><br>
											There’s a long and lonely road up ahead
											But that’s where I need to go
											There’s something that’s calling to me
											Something I need to know
											<br><br>
											I doubt every thing I'm trying to do
											My past keeps catching with me 
											<br><br>
											Don’t wanna be what I’m not…
											I must rewire my thoughts
											Don’t wanna be what I’m not…
											I have rewired my thoughts

											<h2>5.Illusions in My Mind</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											Seems like no one really cares
											When you got a need to share
											When you need someone to understand you
											But when you look around nobody's there
											<br><br>
											This got me down and filled with doubt
											I simply started to block everyone out
											I retreated into darkness and despair
											With illusions of compassion everywhere
											<br><br>
											Was it really only in my mind
											That those around me could be kind?
											Was I lost inside by illusions, trapped inside a dream
											How could I have been so blind?
											Illusions in my mind
											<br><br>
											Could this be all about me?
											Building up a wall of selfish fantasy
											so smoke and mirrors are what the people see
											Not the truth, not reality
											<br><br>
											Was it really only in my mind
											That those around me could be kind?
											Was I lost inside by illusions, trapped inside a dream
											How could I have been so blind?
											Illusions in my mind
											<br><br>
											How could I be so blind?
											Illusions in my mind
											Ah ah ah, illusions in my mind

											<h2>6.Shaken But Not Broken</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											They knocked me down but I got back up X 4
											<br><br>
											They called me every kind of name
											They made me feel so very small 
											They meant to make me feel ashamed
											There was no mercy there at all
											<br><br>
											They knocked me down but I got back up X 4
											<br><br>
											I never gave in, I never lost hope
											They didn’t think I could rise up this way 
											But I was stronger than they could imagine
											They couldn’t break me with all of their hate
											<br><br>
											They knocked me down but I got back up X 4
											<br><br>
											It took a toll that I couldn’t bear
											The guilt, it mounted over me
											But despite the pain that haunted me  
											I held on tight pushed forward on   
											<br><br>
											They knocked me down but I got back up X 4
											<br><br>
											I never gave in, I never lost hope
											They didn’t think I could rise up this way
											But I was stronger, than they could imagine
											They couldn’t break me with all of their hate
											<br><br>
											They knocked me down but I got back up X 3
											<br><br>
											Oou I got back up, oou I got stronger, stronger, stronger oou
											They knocked me down but I got back up
											Oou but I got back up
											They knocked me down but I got back up
											They knocked me down but I got back up

											<h2>8.Life’s Journey</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											My life's jouneywas like passing through the seasons of time
											<br><br>
											In the spring of my life, I was full of wonder
											I was a young tree growing in the rain and thunder
											Lightning crashed around me and my world was shaken
											My soul was weeping, and my heart was breaking
											<br><br>
											And the seasons changed me, oh they rearranged me
											And I grew as years went by
											In the spring of my life
											<br><br>
											In the summer of my life, I thought I was maturing
											Blossoming into fullness but I was still learning
											I was growing wild, and thought that it was freedom
											I made some mistakes, but I couldn’t see them
											<br><br>
											And the seasons changed me, oh they rearranged me
											And I grew as years went by
											In the summer of my life
											<br><br>
											Autumn to winter and my life was bitter,
											Full of what was left undone
											But I found the reason for every season, 
											Led to what I have become - all the seasons of the sun
											<br><br>
											And the years all changed me, they all rearranged me
											And I grew as time went by, in the seasons of my, the seasons of my life
