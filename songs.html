								<h2>1. Never Are You Alone </h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								You’re left in a hopeless situation<br>
								Underwater and so confused<br>
								You want to give up and let yourself drift away<br>
								Gone forever and a day<br>
								<br><br>
								Have you ever thought you were always on your own?<br>
								Left to deal with problems all alone<br>
								Lost and lonely always thinking<br>
								That it felt like you were sinking<br>
								Trust my words, for you are never alone<br>
								<br><br>
								Thinking about them makes your head and heart ache<br>
								Wondering whether you’ll ever be able to break through<br>
								This sense of endless crippling loss<br>
								You spin your wheels and lose control<br>
								<br><br>
								Have you ever thought you were always on your own?<br>
								Left to deal with problems all alone<br>
								Lost and lonely always thinking<br>
								That it felt like you were sinking<br>
								Trust my words, for you are never alone<br>
								<br><br>
								There are many beautiful people out there<br>
								And they are willing to share<br>
								They’ve been through what you’ve had to endure<br>
								While you thought you were all alone<br>
								<br><br>
								Have you ever thought you were always on your own?<br>
								Left to deal with problems all alone<br>
								Lost and lonely always thinking<br>
								That it felt like you were sinking<br>
								Trust my words, for you are never alone<br>
								<br><br>
								Lost and lonely always thinking<br>
								That it felt like you were sinking<br>
								Trust my words, for you are never alone

								I was so innocent,<br>
								Thought you were protected<br>
								Had faith that tomorrow would come<br>

								There was only happiness and love so sweet<br>
								Built a world that would stand<br>

								How could I know what I couldn’t see?<br>
								Have to live with the sorrow, got to make peace<br>
								Gotta move on and remember to breathe<br>

								<h2>5. Illusions in My Mind</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								Seems like no one really cares<br>
								When you got a need to share<br>
								When you need someone to understand you<br>
								When you look around nobody's there<br>
								<br>
								This got me down and filled with doubt<br>
								I simply started to block everyone out<br>
								I retreated into darkness and despair<br>
								With illusions of compassion everywhere<br>
								<br>
								Was it really only in my mind<br>
								That those around me could be kind?<br>
								Was I lost inside by illusions, trapped inside a dream<br>
								How could I have been so blind?<br>
								Illusions in my mind<br>
								<br>
								Could this be all about me?<br>
								Building a wall of selfish fantasy<br>
								So smoke and mirrors are what the people see<br>
								Not the truth, not reality<br>
								<br>
								Was it really only in my mind<br>
								That those around me could be kind?<br>
								Was I lost inside by illusions, trapped inside a dream<br>
								How could I have been so blind?<br>
								Illusions in my mind<br>
								<br>
								How could I be so blind?<br>
								Illusions in my mind<br>
								Ah ah ah, illusions in my mind

								They knocked me down but I got back up X 4<br>
								<br>
								They called me every kind of name<br>
								They made me feel so very small<br>
								They meant to make me feel ashamed<br>
								There was no mercy there at all<br>
								<br>
								They knocked me down but I got back up X 4<br>
								<br>
								I never gave in, I never lost hope<br>
								They didn’t think I could rise up this way<br> 
								But I was stronger than they could imagine<br>
								They couldn’t break me with all of their hate<br>
								<br>
								They knocked me down but I got back up X 4<br>
								<br>
								It took a toll that I couldn’t bear<br>
								The guilt, it mounted over me<br>
								But despite the pain that haunted me<br>  
								I held on tight pushed forward on<br>
								<br>
								They knocked me down but I got back up X 4<br>
								<br><br>
								I never gave in, I never lost hope<br>
								They didn’t think I could rise up this way<br>
								But I was stronger, than they could imagine<br>
								They couldn’t break me with all of their hate<br>
								<br>
								They knocked me down but I got back up X 3<br>
								<br>
								Oou I got back up, oou I got stronger, stronger, stronger oou<br>
								They knocked me down but I got back up<br>
								Oou but I got back up<br>
								They knocked me down but I got back up<br>
								They knocked me down but I got back up

								<h2>7. Together in Strength</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								It’s such a very sad thing to see,<br>
								When people are cruel, and their words are so mean<br>
								They thoughtlessly speak from a dark place inside<br>
								Without really caring about what they leave<br>
								It gives them a false sense of being all powerful<br>
								Gives them the right to pray on the vulnerable<br>
								<br>
								Together we can stand up and over come it all with love<br>
								Drive out the darkness with courage and faith in us<br>
								Oh Together in strength<br>
								<br>
								We must push forward on this path of unity<br>
								Breaking the patterns of mindless hostility<br>
								Learning to speak from a kind place inside<br>
								Putting our fears and our hatred aside<br>
								Wishing and hoping is never enough<br>
								True strength is found when we reach out with love<br>
								<br>
								Together we can stand up and over come it all with love<br>
								Drive out the darkness with courage and faith in us<br>
								Oh Together in strength<br>
								<br>
								Together we can stand up and over come it all with love<br>
								Drive out the darkness with courage and faith in us<br>
								Together we can stand up and over come it all with love<br>
								Drive out the darkness with courage and faith in us<br>
								Oh Together in Strength

								<h2>8. Life’s Journey</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								My life's jouneywas like passing through the seasons of time<br>
								In the spring of my life, I was full of wonder<br>
								I was a young tree growing in the rain and thunder<br>
								Lightning crashed around me and my world was shaken<br>
								My soul was weeping, and my heart was breaking<br>
								<br>
								And the seasons changed me, oh they rearranged me<br>
								And I grew as years went by<br>
								In the spring of my life<br>
								<br>
								In the summer of my life, I thought I was maturing<br>
								Blossoming into fullness but I was still learning<br>
								I was growing wild, and thought that it was freedom<br>
								I made some mistakes, but I couldn’t see them<br>
								<br>
								And the seasons changed me, oh they rearranged me<br>
								And I grew as years went by<br>
								In the summer of my life<br>
								<br>
								Autumn to winter and my life was bitter,<br>
								Full of what was left undone<br>
								But I found the reason for every season,<br>
								Led to what I have become - all the seasons of the sun<br>
								<br>
								And the years all changed me, they all rearranged me<br>
								And I grew as time went by, in the seasons of my, the seasons of my life
